## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project set up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)**: The JavaScript runtime and package manager.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: For version control.
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**: To easily run a local MongoDB instance.

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Fork the Repository**

    Click the **Fork** button at the top-right of this page to create a copy of this repository under your GitHub account.

2.  **Clone Your Fork**

    Clone your forked repository to your local machine. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/puck.git
    cd puck
    ```

3.  **Add the `upstream` Remote**

    This allows you to sync changes from the original repository (`PfadiMH/puck`).

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/PfadiMH/puck.git
    ```

4.  **Start Local MongoDB Database**

    You can start a local database using either `docker compose`.

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables**

    Copy the example environment file to create your local configuration.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

The default values in this file are already configured for the local Docker database, so no changes are required to get started.

6. **Install Dependencies**

   Install all project dependencies using Bun.

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

7. **Run the Development Server**

   You're all set! Start the Next.js development server.

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

   The application will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Using the Editor

The core of this project is the admin dashboard, where you can visually create and manage all pages.

**Viewing Pages:**
Any page you create can be viewed at its public path (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/some-page`).

**Editing and Creating Pages:**
All content management is done through the central admin dashboard.

1.  Navigate to the admin panel: **[http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin)**
2.  From the dashboard, you can either **create a new page** (e.g., with the path `/hello/world`) or select an existing one to edit.
3.  Once you publish your changes in the editor, the page will be live and viewable at its designated path.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from everyone!

### Contribution Workflow

1.  **Sync Your Fork**: Before starting work, ensure your `main` branch is up-to-date with the `upstream` repository.

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    git push origin main
    ```

2.  **Create a New Branch**: Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/new-component` or `fix/styling-issue`).

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/new-puck-component
    ```

3.  **Make Your Changes**: Write your code and create amazing things!

4.  **Commit Your Changes**: Use clear and concise commit messages.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: add new Card component for Puck"
    ```

5.  **Push to Your Fork**:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/new-puck-component
    ```

6.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the original repository on GitHub. You should see a prompt to "Compare & pull request". Click it to start your PR.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title**: Your PR title should be clear (e.g., `feat: Add dark mode toggle`).
- **Description**: Explain the "what," "why," and "how" of your changes. Link any related issues using keywords like `Closes #123`.
- **Checks**: Ensure all automated CI checks (linting, tests) are passing.
