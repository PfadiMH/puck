# /components/ui

This directory contains the core design system of the application: generic, reusable UI primitives.

**Key points:**

- These components are "dumb": they contain no application-specific logic.
- **Ensure:** Components are highly reusable and flexible.
- **Control:** Styling and variants should be controlled via props.
- Develop and test these components in isolation using Storybook.
