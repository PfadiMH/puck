# /components/misc

This directory is a catch-all for miscellaneous, general-purpose utility components.

**Key points:**

- **When to use:** Place components here that encapsulate a specific piece of logic or a common UI pattern that isn't a standard design system primitive (like a Button or Card).
- **Avoid:** Do not place components here that are specific to a single feature or page.
