# /components/graphics

This directory contains SVG assets converted into reusable React components.

**Key points:**

- SVGs are converted to components for greater control over styling and behavior.
- Use `currentColor` for `fill` and `stroke` to allow easy color customization via CSS.
- **Optimization:** SVGs must be optimized using a tool like SVGO before being converted to components to minimize bundle size.
